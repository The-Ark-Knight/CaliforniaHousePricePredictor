# California Housing Prices Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting housing prices in California districts using machine learning. The goal is to build a regression model that can estimate the median house value based on various features. The dataset used for this project is the [California Housing Prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices) from Kaggle.

## Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing data using imputation.
- Perform feature engineering to create new informative features.
- Scale the data to prepare it for modeling.

## Model Building
- Build a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
- Train the model on the training dataset.
- Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.

## Model Evaluation
- Calculate evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Visualize model predictions and compare them to actual values.

## Results
- Summarize key findings and insights from the project.
- Discuss the model's performance and any improvements achieved through model refinement.
- The resultant was calculated based on the following parameters
Mean Absolute Error: 0.4367338817223555
Mean Squared Error: 0.3603952607354783
Root Mean Squared Error: 0.6003292935843446
- this values are very average for a model of this type, to achive more suposticated results i will be refining and rewriting parts of the code to ensure maxixmum accuracy
