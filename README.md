California House Price Predictor
Project Overview

The California House Price Predictor project aims to build a machine learning model to predict house prices in California districts. The project uses a dataset containing various features such as population, median income, and housing median age to make predictions. The goal is to develop a regression model that can estimate house prices accurately based on these features.

Data Exploration

The dataset used in this project contains information about housing prices in California districts. Key aspects of data exploration include:

    Dataset Overview: The dataset comprises X rows and Y columns.
    Summary Statistics: Statistical summary of numeric features.
    Visualizations: Histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
    Insights: Observations about the data, such as feature distributions and potential correlations.

Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involved the following steps:

    Handling Missing Data: Missing values were imputed using appropriate methods.
    Feature Engineering: The dataset was enhanced by creating new features and transformations.
    Data Scaling: Features were standardized to ensure consistent scaling.

Train-Test Split

The data was divided into training and testing sets. An 80-20 split was used, with a random seed for reproducibility. The resulting datasets are as follows:

    Training Data (X_train, y_train)
    Testing Data (X_test, y_test)

Building and Training the Model
